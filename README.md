# README

MIT Course Match is a web application that helps students figure out what major they should choose at MIT. 

**NOTE:** *The project is currently at its early phase, so everything is a bit crazy in the codebase, including this README. Content should become more organized as time passes.*

# How to Collect Data

Some roadblocks ahead:
- There is no incentive to be a subject to collect training data if one has already chosen their major and love it.
  - We'd need to incentivize people to do it somehow. Asking friends to do it can work, but then we wouldn't collect enough training data. Maybe raffles? 
- When collecting the training data, the instructions need to be clear so that people know what to do.
- To reach a lot of people, we'll need to dormspam like crazy. Also, only upperclassmen should be elligible. 
- If people "sign-up", then we can set a reminder to ask them to label (say what course they have chosen) their course 1 year after they login (or on a specific set of dates in the academic year after they sign up).
