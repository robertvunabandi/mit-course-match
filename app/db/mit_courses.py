"""
these represent the MIT courses that we have so far. These courses
need to be updated in case any change happen. in this table, we
explicitly do not have course subsets (like 6-1, 6-2, etc) because
this can change pretty regularly. it's easier to maintain a list of
just the major course numbers. we made an exception for course 21
specifically because its subsets are quite inherently different.
